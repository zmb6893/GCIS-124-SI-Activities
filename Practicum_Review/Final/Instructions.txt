Final Review Practical Portion:

These are review questions based on the past three units we went over in class, 
including threading, concurrent programming, and networking.

We will be working through the following problems:
    1.  A traffic circle can have multiple cars driving on it at once. One car can  
        leave the traffic circle at a time. Keep track of the cars that are in the 
        traffic circle at a given time. Cars can enter and exit the traffic circle at 
        the same time. Come up with a solution using threads to demonstrate this 
        problem.
            Hints:
                - What will the shared resource(s) be?
                - How will you keep track of who is in the circle?
    2.  Hangman. Create a game of hangman that allows multiple users to play at once.
        You will be using networking concepts for this problem.
