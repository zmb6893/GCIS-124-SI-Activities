Winner gets to choose a prize.

A fruit should have a name, color, and price. Every fruit can be
eaten, but the process may vary (Example: peel a banana vs bite 
into an apple). The eat function should print the steps to eat the 
fruit.

Make a class for fruits.

Extend that class to make a banana and a pineapple.

Make a toString for your fruits. (Example: "yellow banana ($0.25)")
